WP Blank Theme
==============

I do not like Wordpress. But many of my projects require Wordpress. So I decided to make a completely blank Wordpress theme that can be used as a starting point for any Wordpress project. There is nothing in this theme. No promises of semantic HTML5 boilerplate setup, no magic-JS things and no `functions.php` file that does some evil magic shit you don't expect. There are no comment templates. I'm not even including the sidebar (who the hell uses sidebars nowadays?). Just plain, unformatted page/post loop with one custom page template. Oh, and yes if you have SASS installed there is some minor support for that as well.

Made for people that do not enjoy Wordpress very much.
